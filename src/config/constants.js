      "The system will utilize image processing and computer vision techniques, such as feature extraction and object detection, to analyze the images and detect abnormalities. The extracted features will be used to train machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) & SVmM, to classify the images into different categories based on the detected abnormalities. Tk inter Graphical User Interface(GUI) is used.",

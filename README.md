Welcome to the JunaidPortfolio repository! This project showcases my portfolio, built with modern web development practices. This is a personal portfolio project designed to display my skills, projects, and experience. It is built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## ðŸš¨ Important Notice: Forking!

Many people have contacted me asking if they can use this code for their own website, and the answer to that question is usually yes, with attribution.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, plagiarism is bad. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

**Please do not clone this repository. Instead, fork it so that you can make your own changes while still giving credit to the original author.**
